# üìò MDIS - Malware Dictionaries

This document describes the complete set of dictionaries used by **MDIS** (Malware Detection and Identification System) to standardize and define malware. These dictionaries allow the system to easily parse, extract, and display information in a format that is human-readable and machine-processable.
